this is a dummy apk file for testing purposes

if you want to use the real apk file, you need to create it first
by running this command:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

the resulting apk file will be located in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory
rename the file to `rocket-app-latest.apk` and place it in this directory instead of this dummy file
